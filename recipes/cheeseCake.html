    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Wrap outside of a lightly greased (with cooking spray)
            9-inch springform pan with a double layer of heavy-duty aluminum foil.

        </li>
        <li>Stir together cookies, melted butter, and granulated sugar in a bowl. Press onto bottom and 1-inch up sides
            of prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is set, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack; cool completely, 30
            minutes.

        </li>
        <li>Preheat the oven again to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).

        </li>
        <li>Process chopped strawberries in a food processor until completely smooth, about 1 minute, stopping to scrape
            down sides as needed. Set strawberry puree aside.</li>
        <li>Beat cream cheese with a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment on medium speed until creamy, 2 to 3
            minutes. Gradually add sugar and flour, beating until smooth, about 1 minute. Add whole eggs, 1 at a time,
            beating on low speed just until blended after each addition (do not overbeat). Add egg yolks, 1 at a time,
            beating until just blended after each addition.</li>
        <li>
            Beat in reserved strawberry puree, vanilla, lemon zest, and lemon juice on low speed just until combined.
            Gently stir in food coloring gel until desired shade is reached.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour batter into the prepared pan (pan will be full). Place cheesecake in a large roasting pan. Place
            roasting pan with cheesecake in preheated oven and pour very hot water into roasting pan half-way up sides
            of cheesecake.


        </li>
        <li>
            Remove cheesecake from oven, and gently run a knife around outer edge of cheesecake to loosen from sides of
            pan. (Do not remove sides of pan.) Cool completely in pan on a wire rack, about 2 hours. Cover with aluminum
            foil; chill 8 to 24 hours.

        <li>
            Prepare Chocolate Ganache Topping: Bring cream to a light simmer in a small saucepan over medium. Place
            chopped chocolate in a small heatproof bowl. Pour hot cream over chocolate in bowl and let stand 1 minute.
            Whisk chocolate mixture until completely smooth. Let mixture cool until very slightly warm, whisking
            occasionally, about 20 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Assemble Cheesecake: Dip a few whole strawberries in ganache and chill until ready to top cheesecake. Remove
            sides of pan from cheesecake and place on a serving platter. Slowly pour ganache over top of cheesecake,
            spreading to edges with a small offset spatula. Chill for 1 hour.
