    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This classic lemonade recipe is the one my mom used to make for me when I was little. </p>
    <p>Ah, the taste of summer! It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. When using a clear pitcher, adding a few of the juiced lemon halves makes it look prettier.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 lemons</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>6 cups water, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Juice lemons; you should have 1 cup juice.</li>
        <li>Combine juice, sugar, and water in a 1/2-gallon pitcher. Stir until sugar dissolves. Taste and add more water if desired.</li>
        <li>Chill and serve over ice.</li>
    </ol>
